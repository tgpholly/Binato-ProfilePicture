# Binato-ProfilePicture
The profile picture server for my osu!bancho server
<hr>

A simple HTTP server to fire profile pictures back for my bancho server

The picture to send if a user has no profile picture is DefaultProfilePicture.png in the ProfilePictures folder
For user's profile pictures do <user_id>.png

## Things that need to be implemented:
 - Ability to upload profile pictures
    - Authenticated?
 - Ability to auto resize and compress profile pictures
